# Plant-Disease-Detection
A plant disease detection project leverages machine learning to identify and classify diseases in plants from images. It uses techniques like image preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) to analyze leaf patterns and spot anomalies. This helps farmers take timely actions, improving crop health and yield.
